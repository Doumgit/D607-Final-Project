# INTRODUCTION

This project delves into the analysis of audiobooks, beginning with data acquisition through web scraping using Selenium. Selenium's automation capabilities were essential for dynamically navigating web pages and extracting detailed audiobook information. This approach was crucial for capturing diverse and complex data elements, which were then saved in CSV format.

Post-acquisition, the project follows the OSEMN framework and Hadley Wickhamâ€™s Grammar of Data Science. The data, initially scraped and saved as CSV, is further processed in R for cleaning, parsing, and transformation, preparing it for comprehensive analysis. This seamless integration of Selenium in our data collection phase lays a solid groundwork for the detailed exploratory and analytical work that follows in R.

```


# Data Tydying

## Parsing and Cleaning 'authors', 'narrators', and 'genres' Fields
 parse and cleaning the 'authors' and 'narrators' fields using str_replace_all to remove unwanted characters and extract the necessary information.
 
1. Cleans up the 'authors' and 'narrators' columns.
2. Relocates the cleaned columns next to the originals.
3. Drops the original 'authors' and 'narrators' columns.
4. Renames the cleaned columns to 'authors' and 'narrators'.

```{r data tydying}
# Cleaning 'authors' and 'narrators', relocating them, dropping the original, and renaming the cleaned columns
audible_books <- audible_books %>%
  mutate(
    authors_cleaned = str_replace_all(authors, "\\['|'\\]", ""),
    narrators_cleaned = str_replace_all(narrators, "\\['|'\\]", "")
  ) %>%
  relocate(authors_cleaned, .after = authors) %>%
  relocate(narrators_cleaned, .after = narrators) %>%
  select(-authors, -narrators) %>%
  rename(
    authors = authors_cleaned,
    narrators = narrators_cleaned
  )

head(audible_books)
```

## Extracting Numeric Data from 'length', 'rating', and 'no_of_ratings'
extract the numeric data from the 'length', 'rating', and 'no_of_ratings' columns. We'll use str_extract to pull out the numbers, and for the 'rating', we'll also remove the 'out of 5 stars' text.
```{r Cleaning lenght, rating and no_of_ratings}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

audible_books <- audible_books %>%
  mutate(
    # Extracting hours and convert to numeric, replacing NA with 0 if only minutes are present
    length_hours = as.numeric(str_extract(length, "\\b\\d+\\b(?=\\s*hr)")) %>% replace_na(0),
    # Extracting minutes and convert to numeric, replacing NA with 0 if only hours are present
    length_minutes = as.numeric(str_extract(length, "\\b\\d+\\b(?=\\s*min)")) %>% replace_na(0),
    # Calculating total length in minutes
    total_length_minutes = (length_hours * 60) + length_minutes,
    # Extracting numeric rating and number of ratings
    rating_numeric = as.numeric(str_extract(rating, "\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?")),
    no_of_ratings_numeric = as.numeric(str_extract(no_of_ratings, "\\b\\d+"))
  ) %>%
  select(-length_hours, -length_minutes) %>%
  relocate(total_length_minutes, .after = length) %>%
  relocate(rating_numeric, .after = rating) %>%
  relocate(no_of_ratings_numeric, .after = no_of_ratings)

head(audible_books)
```


## Handling Missing Data

## Standardizing 'release_date' and 'language': 
Extracts and converts the 'release_date' to a date format.
Extracts the language name from the 'language' field.
Relocates the standardized columns next to the originals.
Drops the original 'release_date' and 'language' columns.
Renames the standardized columns to 'release_date' and 'language'.
```{r Standardizing release_date and language}
# Standardizing 'release_date' and extracting just the language name from 'language', rearranging them, dropping the original, and renaming them
audible_books <- audible_books %>%
  mutate(
    release_date_standardized = as.Date(str_extract(release_date, "\\d{2}-\\d{2}-\\d{2,4}"), format = "%m-%d-%y"),
    language_standardized = str_replace(language, "Language: ", "")
  ) %>%
  relocate(release_date_standardized, .after = release_date) %>%
  relocate(language_standardized, .after = language) %>%
  select(-release_date, -language) %>%
  rename(
    release_date = release_date_standardized,
    language = language_standardized
  )

head(audible_books)
```

## Formatting Price Fields
The regular_price_numeric and sales_price_numeric columns are created by extracting the numeric values from 'regular_price' and 'sales_price'.
The sales_status column is determined based on whether sales_price_numeric is NA or not.
The newly created columns are relocated next to their respective original columns.
The original 'regular_price' and 'sales_price' columns are then removed from the dataframe.


```{r Formatting Price Fields}
# Processing 'regular_price' and 'sales_price', create 'sales_status' column, rearrange, drop the original, and rename
audible_books <- audible_books %>%
  mutate(
    regular_price_numeric = as.numeric(str_extract(regular_price, "\\d+\\.\\d+")),
    sales_price_numeric = as.numeric(str_extract(sales_price, "\\d+\\.\\d+")),
    sales_status = ifelse(is.na(sales_price_numeric), "not on sale", "on sale")
  ) %>%
  relocate(regular_price_numeric, .after = regular_price) %>%
  relocate(sales_price_numeric, .after = sales_price) %>%
  relocate(sales_status, .after = sales_price_numeric) %>%
  select(-regular_price, -sales_price)


head(audible_books)
```


## Addressing Empty 'genres' Field

## Consistency in Series Information

## URLs Verification
Checking URL Format

```{r URLs Verification}
# Function to check if a URL is properly formatted
is_valid_url <- function(url) {
  # Basic pattern for a URL 
  pattern <- "^http[s]?://.+"
  return(str_detect(url, pattern))
}

# Apply the function to the URL column
audible_books <- audible_books %>%
  mutate(url_valid = sapply(url, is_valid_url))

head(audible_books)
```

## Checking URL Accessibility
To check if the URLs are accessible (i.e., they lead to an active web page), we used the httr package.

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(httr)

# Defining a function to scrape reviews for a single URL using XPath
scrape_reviews_xpath <- function(url) {
  if (is.na(url) || url == "") {
    return(NA)
  }
  
  # Handling errors
  tryCatch({
    # Sending a GET request to the URL with a user-agent
    response <- httr::GET(url, user_agent("Mozilla/5.0"))
    if (status_code(response) != 200) {
      return(NA)
    }
    page <- read_html(response$content, encoding = "UTF-8")
    
    # Using XPath to select elements containing reviews
    reviews <- page %>%
      html_nodes(xpath = '//div[contains(@class, "bc-tab-set")]/a[contains(@class, "bc-tab-heading")]') %>%
      html_text(trim = TRUE)
    
    return(reviews)
  }, error = function(e) {
    return(NA)
  })
}

# Initializing a counter for progress feedback
counter <- 1
total_urls <- length(audible_books$url)

# Applying the function to each URL in your dataframe
audible_books$reviews <- sapply(audible_books$url, function(url) {
  message(paste("Processing URL", counter, "of", total_urls))
  counter <<- counter + 1
  scrape_reviews_xpath(url)
}, USE.NAMES = FALSE)

# Audiobook Length Analysis
The histogram of audiobook lengths shows a concentration of audiobooks under 700 minutes, with a median of 532 minutes. This indicates a user preference for audiobooks around 9 hours long, suitable for consuming in a day or a week. The mean length is slightly higher at 579 minutes, hinting at longer audiobooks influencing the average. With the longest audiobook at 2762 minutes, there's content for users who enjoy extensive listening. The distribution suggests a varied catalog with a focus on moderate-length audiobooks.

```{r}
# Summary statistics for audiobook lengths
length_summary <- summary(audible_books$total_length_minutes)
length_summary

# Histogram of audiobook lengths
ggplot(audible_books, aes(x = total_length_minutes)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Audiobook Lengths", x = "Total Length (minutes)", y = "Frequency")
```

# Rating Distribution
The density plot of audiobook ratings shows a strong skew towards high ratings, with a peak at 5.0 indicating a large number of audiobooks receiving perfect scores. This concentration of high ratings suggests either a selection of high-quality titles or a tendency among users to rate audiobooks favorably. The mean rating is 4.84, supporting this trend towards higher ratings. The range is narrow, with the lowest rating at 4.5, showcasing overall positive reception. The data indicates users of this audiobook platform are likely to encounter content that is well-received by others, which could be a strong selling point for the service.

```{r Rating Distribution}
# Summary statistics for audiobook lengths
rating_summary <- summary(audible_books$rating_numeric)
rating_summary

rating_frequency <- audible_books %>% select (rating_numeric) %>% group_by(rating_numeric) %>% count()
rating_frequency


# Histogram or density plot of audiobook ratings
ggplot(audible_books, aes(x = rating_numeric)) +
 #geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "grey", color = "purple") +
  geom_density(fill = "green", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Audiobook Ratings", x = "Rating", y = "Density")
```

# Number of Rating Distribution
The "Distribution of Number Of Rating" histogram, together with the R console's summary statistics, provides a concise visual and quantitative analysis of the audiobook ratings count in the dataset. The bulk of audiobooks receive fewer ratings, with frequency declining as the number of ratings increases, pointing to a select few audiobooks attracting a high volume of ratings. The summary further details that the median is at 15, suggesting half of the audiobooks have 15 or fewer ratings, while the mean is slightly elevated at 28.3 due to the influence of a few highly-rated audiobooks. This disparity between the mean and median indicates the skewed nature of the distribution. Additionally, the first and third quartiles stand at 11 and 25 ratings respectively, revealing that 25% of the audiobooks have fewer than 11 ratings, and 75% have fewer than 25. This insight reflects on the listeners' engagement, suggesting a concentration of popularity among a small number of titles and potentially highlighting a need for further promotion or time to accumulate ratings for the others. 

```{r Number of rating per books}
# Summary statistics for Number Of Rating
number_ofRating_summary <- summary(audible_books$no_of_ratings_numeric)
number_ofRating_summary

frequency <- audible_books %>% select(no_of_ratings_numeric) %>% group_by(no_of_ratings_numeric) %>% count()
frequency

# Histogram of Number Of Rating
ggplot(audible_books, aes(x = no_of_ratings_numeric)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Number Of Rating", x = "Total Number Of Rating", y = "Frequency")
```


# Relationship Between Ratings and Length
The scatter plot depicting "Audiobook Ratings vs. Total Length" coupled with the correlation coefficient of -0.1491 indicates a minor negative relationship between an audiobook's length and its ratings, albeit this relationship is not strong. This trend suggests that longer audiobooks may receive marginally lower ratings on average, but the correlation is weak, which points to other factors likely playing a more pivotal role in determining ratings.

In the context of the project, this finding is informative because it highlights that while the length of an audiobook might have a slight impact on its rating, it is not a substantial influence. This nuance is important for stakeholders who might consider the length of audiobooks as a factor in production or marketing strategies. It emphasizes that content quality, genre, narrator performance, or other elements might be more critical in affecting listener satisfaction and ratings. The project's analysis illustrates that data-driven decisions in the audiobook industry cannot rely on length alone but should consider a broader range of factors to understand and predict listener preferences and ratings effectively.

```{r Rating vs Length}
# Correlation analysis between ratings and total length
correlation_length_rating <- cor(audible_books$rating_numeric, audible_books$total_length_minutes, use = "complete.obs")

# Relationship Between Ratings and Number of Ratings
Analysis of the audiobook dataset reveals a landscape where a few titles receive a high number of ratings, but most accumulate fewer engagements, as shown in the histogram "Distribution of Number Of Rating" and its associated statistics. This trend is supported by the scatterplot "Audiobook Ratings vs. Number of Ratings," which, with a slight negative correlation, suggests that higher-rated audiobooks do not always equate to higher engagement. These insights are essential for understanding the distribution of listener engagement across the audiobook collection, highlighting potential areas for strategic marketing and positioning within the audiobook market.

```{r Rating vs Number of Rating}
# Correlation analysis between ratings and number of ratings
correlation_result <- cor(audible_books$rating_numeric, audible_books$no_of_ratings_numeric, use = "complete.obs")
